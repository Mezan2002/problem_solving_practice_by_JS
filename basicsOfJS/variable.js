// all programming languages has that variable
// variables are used for save a value for another use and it could be changed
// vary + able = variable which means that thing which can be changed at any time like your age
// there are 3 keywords to declare a variable in JS but we will know only the var in that time
// different programming languages has different style to write the variables in that case we are learing JavaScript so in javascript the variable written style is down below:
// 1. declare the variable keyword which is var
// 2. give a name of the variable
// 3. give an qual sign
// 4. then assign the value of the variable,
// 5. use the semi colon (;) sign to end the variable
// example down below:

var age = 21;

// :::best practices about creating a variable:::
// 1. a variable name should be understandable and unique
// 2. variable names aren't starts with any type of number if you need a number then add the number at the end of the name
// 3. variable name wouldn't take any space or blank places
// 4. if the variable name contains more than one word then you can use the underscore (is_single) or the camel casing (isSingle)

// task : create 5 variables for practicing the variable declaration

var tempareture = 40;
var price = 500;
var rollNumber = 5;
var number_of_cars = 0;
var number_of_mobiles = 4;
